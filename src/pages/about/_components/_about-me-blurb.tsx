        From an early age, I was introduced to Halo by a friend and got hooked
        into gaming. Like many, I got into Computer Science to build games, but
        in doing so found a world of much more.

        Through school, I learned just how vast the realm of CS is and
        questioned what path I should take. Tesla was becoming more and more
        popular and I saw what they were doing with Machine Learning and A.I; So
        I made these my focus. I was drawn towards this path because I wanted to
        help develop life-changing technologies that impact and shape the world
        we live in.

        Near the end of my schooling career, I was afforded an opportunity to
        become a Frontend Software Engineer and in doing so have found that
        there are more ways to impact and shape the world than disrupting the
        automotive industry.
